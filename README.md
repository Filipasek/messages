# Messenger app

An app written in Flutter that allows its users to use multiple messaging services like Messenger or Telegram in a single app.

## Current state

Currently this app can display thread list with messages but can't reply or anything else (yes, you can log in into your own account)

### Release date

Unknown. Probably by summer.

### Where can I get it?

As soon as it gets into usable state, it'll be available in Google's Play Store and Huawei AppGallery. 

[Support for Web](https://flutter.dev/web) is coming, too! [Mac, Linux and Windows support](https://flutter.dev/desktop) depends entirely on [Flutter team](https://github.com/flutter).

Unfortunately, Apple's AppStore is too [expensive](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/App_Store_(iOS)#Monetization) and I won't upload this app there. But you can compile this app yourself (or ask me to) and force-install it.
