# Messenger app

An app written in Flutter that allows its users to use multiple messaging services like Messenger or Telegram in a single app.

## Current state

Currently this app can display thread list with messages but can't reply or anything else (yes, you can log in into your own account)

### Release date

Unknown. Probably by summer.

### Where can I get it?

As soon as it gets into usable state, it'll be available in Google's Play Store and Huawei AppGallery. 

Support for Web is coming, too! Mac, Linux and Windows support depends entirely on Flutter team.

Unfortunately, Apple's AppStore is too expensive and I won't upload this app there. But you can compile this app yourself (or ask me to) and force-install it.
